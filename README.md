## Day 1: Historian Hysteria
First time attending, going blind. Slow start but setup is ready for next days.

## Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
Managed to stay up and finish it in a couple of hours.
Was slow considering not being too complex, probably won't do it again...

## Day 3: "Mull It Over"
Was interesting, overdeveloped parser for this problem, but did the job.

## Day 4: Ceres Search
Part 1 was annoying because I initially didn't understand the task correctly and found out only after I fully implemented it.
Part 2 was quick and fun.

## Day 5: Print Queue
Got a bit stuck on part1 because I didn't read the last paragraph, but overall it was smooth and fun.
Based on yesterday and today, seems using functional programming in part 1 makes implementing part 2 much faster.
It also made testing of part 2 logic much simpler, though there was no need for test because the answer was correct first try past 2 days.

## Day 6: Guard Gallivant

Good exercise for mini-game creation. Part 1 is working, Part 2 is incomplete.

## Day 7: Bridge Repair

Though part 1 is very fast, part 2 takes about a minute to complete.
Minimal logic change between parts and just the operation structure expanded from 1-bit representation of operation to 2-bits.
Lots of room for optimization, but moving on for now.
