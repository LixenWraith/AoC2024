## Day 4: Ceres Search
part 1 was annoying because I went on a completely wrong direction, but part 2 was quick and fun.

## Day 5: Print Queue
got a bit stuck on part1 because I didn't read the last paragraph, but overall it was smooth and fun.
based on yesterday and today, seems functional programming and making the first part makes the second part much easier to implement.
also makes testing of part 2 logic much simpler, though there was no need for test because the answer was correct first try past 2 days.
